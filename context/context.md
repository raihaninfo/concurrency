## Context

Go context is considered one of the most widely used Go types after its introduction in 1.7. Often combined with goroutines, it simplifies data processing, cancellation, and other operations. As an interface with only four functions, time(Deadline), signal(Done), exception(error), and data(Value), it is not complicated but super-useful in different scenarios, covering almost every aspect in common usage.
